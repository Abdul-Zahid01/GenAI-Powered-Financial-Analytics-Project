# Restaurant Financial Analytics — AI-Powered Dashboard

Project that provides an interactive Streamlit dashboard for restaurant sales analysis with an integrated generative AI assistant that can produce executable analysis code from a prompt.

## Quick Links (workspace files & symbols)
- [app.py](app.py) — main Streamlit app and AI orchestration.
- [GenModel.py](GenModel.py) — small example that lists available generative models.
- [.env](.env) — environment file containing GOOGLE_API_KEY (do NOT commit secrets to public repos).
- [daily_sales.csv](daily_sales.csv) — sample compact CSV.
- [Restaurant_Sales_Data.csv](Restaurant_Sales_Data.csv) — full dataset sample.

Key symbol:
- [`app.execute_ai_code`](app.py) — sandboxed executor used to run code generated by the AI model.

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Streamlit dashboard that:
- Loads restaurant sales CSV files.
- Cleans and enriches the dataset (date parsing, missing manager handling, price imputation, revenue calculation).
- Presents metrics, interactive charts, and a raw-data inspector.
- Integrates Google Generative AI (Gemini) to generate Python code that produces a strategic report and visuals. The generated code is shown to the user and executed in a sandbox via [`app.execute_ai_code`](app.py).

## File structure
- app.py — main Streamlit application (entry point).
- GenModel.py — example script showing how to query available generative models with google.generativeai.
- .env — local environment variables (GOOGLE_API_KEY).
- daily_sales.csv — smaller example dataset.
- Restaurant_Sales_Data.csv — larger dataset.

Open files:
- [app.py](app.py)
- [GenModel.py](GenModel.py)
- [.env](.env)

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Packages (install via pip):
  - streamlit
  - pandas
  - python-dotenv
  - google-generative-ai (or the package name used)
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - numpy

Setup & Configuration
Copy your API key into .env:
Key name used: GOOGLE_API_KEY (see .env).
Do not push .env with secrets to public repos.
(Optional) Create a virtual environment and install dependencies.

Usage
- Copy your Google API key into the .env file as GOOGLE_API_KEY (do NOT commit secrets to public repos).
- Install dependencies (recommended inside a virtual environment):
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
  - If you don't have a requirements.txt, install the following packages:
    - streamlit
    - pandas
    - python-dotenv
    - google-generative-ai
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn
    - numpy

Running the app locally
- Start the Streamlit app:
  - streamlit run app.py
- Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser to view the dashboard.

Project features
- Load and explore restaurant sales CSV files (daily_sales.csv for compact testing, Restaurant_Sales_Data.csv for a larger sample).
- Automatic data cleaning and enrichment: date parsing, missing manager handling, price imputation, and revenue calculation.
- Interactive Streamlit UI with metrics, charts, filters, and a raw-data inspector.
- Integrated generative AI assistant (Gemini / Google Generative AI) that can suggest and produce Python analysis code from a natural-language prompt.

AI assistant and safe code execution
- Generated code is shown to the user before execution so you can review it.
- The app uses a sandboxed executor function (app.execute_ai_code) to run AI-generated code with restricted permissions and time/resource limits; never run untrusted code outside this sandbox.
- Do not include secrets (API keys, credentials) in prompts or generated code; keep secrets in the .env file and do not expose them to the generative model.

Development notes
- GenModel.py demonstrates how to list or query available generative models using the google.generativeai client.
- If you change dependencies, update requirements.txt (pip freeze > requirements.txt) to keep environments reproducible.
- Logging and error handling: the app logs AI requests and execution results; review logs for debugging unexpected behavior.

Contributing
- Suggested workflow:
  - Fork the repository, create a feature branch, and open a pull request.
  - Add tests or sample notebooks when adding analysis features.
  - Keep sensitive information out of commits and PRs (use .env and add it to .gitignore).
- Please provide clear descriptions for changes and update this README when adding/removing features.

Troubleshooting
- If Streamlit fails to start:
  - Ensure Python 3.9+ is used and dependencies are installed.
  - Activate your virtual environment and re-run: pip install -r requirements.txt
- If the AI integration fails:
  - Verify GOOGLE_API_KEY in .env and check quota/permissions in your Google Cloud project.
  - Inspect logs for API error messages and rate limits.
